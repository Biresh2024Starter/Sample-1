          *The full picture of both the schools is not available due to the lack of professional photography. The exact acreage for South Point Junior School is not explicitly mentioned. But South Point High School covers a total area of approx. 39226 square meters (about 0.97 acres). There is another South Point School being built in Kolkata and the construction is still ongoing. The infrastructure of this school is believed to be completely set up by 2027 and be open to all Pointers (as students of South Point School are called). The new campus shall be named "South Point Priyamvada Birla Campus" and will cover an impressive 6.65 acres of land. This ultra-modernic academic infrastructure is named after Late Smt. Priyamvada Birla, a philanthropist and the wife of M.P. Birla Group founder Late Shri Madhav Prasad Birla.

              South Point High School, located in Kolkata, has taken a historic step into space exploration by launching its own student nano-satellite named PriyamvadaSat. This initiative marks the school's 70th anniversary and coincides with India's 75th year of independence. The satellite, named in memory of late Smt. Priyamvada Birla, former President of South Point Education Society, aims to provide students with hands-on experience in space science and coding. Additionally, the school will establish a Space Lab on its premises, allowing students to monitor PriyamvadaSat and engage in standard lab practices. This exciting venture brings the future closer to South Point's students.
